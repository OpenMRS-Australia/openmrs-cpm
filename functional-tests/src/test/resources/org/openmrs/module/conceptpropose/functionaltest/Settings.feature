Feature: Settings Page
  As an administrator
  I want to set the central repository's URL
  So that proposals may be sent to a specified dictionary

  @Selenium
  Scenario: Saves central dictionary settings
#    Given I'm on the Concept Proposal Settings page
#    When I enter the settings for a dictionary
#    And I refresh the page
#    Then those settings should still be there
